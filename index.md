<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>Contoso Furnishings, a local home goods store, has hired you to create an app for their store catalog. They'd like the app to enable their customers to do the following:

<ul>
<li>Measure their space using an in-app MR ruler</li>
<li>View and filter a catalog of products</li>
<li>View products in their space</li>
<li>Take a photo of products in their space</li>
<li>View all photos taken within the app</li>
</ul>

You've decided that Power Apps would be the ideal platform for creating the app. Your task is to create an app for Contoso Furnishings using Power Apps.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Using the Power Apps platform for this workshop requires that you have access to a sandbox environment. You can get a sandbox environment as part of the M365 Developer Program. Sign-up is free but does require a phone number for authentication to ensure that your account is protected.

Follow the <a href="https://aprilspeight.github.io/workshop-mr-powerapps/01-prerequisities.html">Prerequisites</a> instructions to setup your sandbox environment.</p>
