## Connect the Data

Data is at the core of most apps, including the data you build in Power Apps. Data is stored in a data source, and you bring that data into your app by creating a connection. The connection uses a specific connector to talk to the data source. Power Apps has connectors for many popular services and on-premises data sources, including SharePoint, SQL Server, Office 365, Salesforce, and Twitter. A connector may provide tables of data or actions. Some connectors provide only tables, some provide only actions, and some provide both. Also your connector may be either a standard or custom connector.

For the Contoso Furnishings app, you'll need to connect the app to the Excel spreadsheet which contains the product information. Fortunately, the Excel spreadsheet is saved to OneDrive for Business, one of the many supported data connectors!

## Instructions

Complete the steps below to connect the production information data.
