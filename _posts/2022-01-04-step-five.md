## Add the Measure in MR Control

It's quite common to want to measure how much space is available prior to purchasing a piece of furniture or dÃ©cor accessory. Contoso Furnishing would like to give customers the opportunity to do so without the need of finding an actual tape measure. Fortunately, Power Apps has a Measure in Mixed Reality control that would enable such a feature for the app!

The Measure in MR control lets you measure distance, area, and volume. During the measurement, you create 2D and 3D polygons that can be used to confirm how a certain-sized object would fit within a space. The control creates a button in your app. When the customer selects the button, it shows a live camera feed of their device. The customer can then identify a starting point and measure individual points in their space. The distances of measured segments are shown directly on the live camera feed.

## Instructions

Complete the steps below to add the Measure in MR control.
