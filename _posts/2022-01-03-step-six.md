## Create Product Gallery Screen

The Contoso Furnishings app is in need of a page that lists all of the store products. Customers should be able to complete the following actions on the page:

- View a list of all products (including image, name, and price)
- Filter products by product category
- Select a product to view the respective product information

## Instructions

Complete the steps below to create the Product Gallery for the **Home** screen.


### Create Product Gallery

1. In the left panel, click **Tree View** and select the **Home** screen.
1. In the left panel, click the **Insert** icon and select **Vertical Gallery**.
1. On the **Select a data source** window that appears, select the **Products** data source.

1. In the left panel, rename the **Gallery** component **ProductGallery**.
1. Using the scale controls, resize the **ProductGallery** component to display 5 rows and move the **ProductGallery** to align with the bottom of the app screen.

### Configure Product Gallery Rows
Each row in the ProductGallery displays a product. Changes made in one row effects all the rows. The row currently consists of 3 elements:

- Image1 (currently not visible since there is no image data configured)
- Title1 (currently displays the product category)
- Subtitle1 (currently displays the product description)

You'll now modify the first row to populate each element in the row with the corresponding product information.

- Product Image
- Product Name
- Price

1. In the **Tree View** panel, expand the **ProductGallery** component to view the aforementioned elements.
1. Click the **Image** element.
1. In the formula bar, for **Image** enter `ThisItem.Picture`. The picture for each product should now display.
1. Click the **Title** element.
1. In the formula bar, for **Text** enter `ThisItem.Name`. The name for each product should now display.
1. Click the **Subtitle** element.
1. In the formula bar, for **Text** enter `"$" & ThisItem.Price`. The price for each product should now display.

### Create Gallery Filter

1. In the left panel, click **Tree View** and select the **Home** screen.
1. In the left panel, click the **Insert** icon and select **Input** > **Drop down**.
1. In the left panel, rename the **Drop down** component **DropdownFilter**.
1. In the left panel, select the **DropdownFilter** component.
1. In the formula bar, for **Items** enter `["All Products", "Living Room", "Office", "Kitchen"]`. This configures the drop down options.
1. In the left panel, select the **ProductGallery** component.
1. In the formula bar, for Items enter the following which configures filtering:
    ```
    	If(
    	    DropdownFilter.Selected.Value = "All Products",
    	    Sort(
    	        Products,
    	        Name
    	    ),
    	    Filter(
    	        Products,
    	        Category = DropdownFilter.Selected.Value
    	    )
    	)
    ```

### Try it Out

Previously, you tested the app on your mobile device. You can also test your app in the browser. There are two methods to test the app in the browser:

#### Play Screen

1. On far right of the top navigation, click the **Play** icon.

    ![A screenshot of the power apps window. The play icon is highlighted.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/6-play-icon.jpg)

1. On the **Play** screen, test the drop down filter to validate whether the products are filtered correctly.
1. After testing the app, click the **X** to exit the Play screen.

    **Note**: Once you enter exit the Play screen, the portal displays the ProductGallery results using the last filter that was applied. To return to displaying all products, change the drop down selection to **All Products** before exiting the Play screen.

#### Canvas Screen

Press **Alt** on your keyboard and select the controls within the app.
